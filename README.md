# EPIGRAPHY-CLUB-2015
_A volunteer group of students creating Leiden-compliant, EpiDoc editions of the unpublished Latin &amp; Greek inscriptions at Columbia's Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library._

##Workflow
`Adapted from: https://help.github.com/articles/github-flow-in-the-browser/ <-- Follow the steps at each point.`

1. A new file is uploaded to the Github repository from the DropBox folder, and given the same name.
2. Person (A) creates a new branch (named after that file and the iteration: e.g. the first attempt to branch #422 would be "icolbutler-422-1"; the 2nd attempt to branch #26 is "icolbutler-26-2"). **Each file may only be branched from the master or worked on by ONE collaborator at a time, otherwise this will create a BUG! Please wait for the branch to be merged first by your colleague.**
3. (A) marks up the edition, saving each commit with a clear and intuitive title and description, and flagging issues for discussion with the group.
4. (A) then requests feedback from others (Persons B, C) by pull request, committing their changes as necessary.
5. (A) merges the final edition _mutatis mutandis_ to the master and marked as MARKEDUP.
6. Repeat for every file.

n.b. We will need to come up with ideas about best practices for communication -- something intuitive but standardized which we will want to query, organize, or search for later on. The Golden Rule is: write titles and descriptions with the clarity and diligence that you would love others to do for you.

##Tags:
* I would suggest, if not already done, compiling a list of core (required) elements that must be included in every document. Some of this will be descriptive, and some administrative. Subsumed under that, a list of elements that are not required, but which are either recommended or are entirely voluntary. This list can be added to a folder on the Github page, which will contain all such Best Practices.
