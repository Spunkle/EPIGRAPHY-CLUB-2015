# EPIGRAPHY-CLUB-2015
_A volunteer group of students creating Leiden-compliant, EpiDoc editions of the unpublished Latin &amp; Greek inscriptions at Columbia's Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library._

##Workflow
`Adapted from: https://help.github.com/articles/github-flow-in-the-browser/ <-- Follow the steps at each point.`
1. Create a new branch (let's say, named after that file and the iteration: e.g. the first attempt to branch #422 would be "icolbutler-422-1"; the 2nd attempt to branch #26 is "icolbutler-26-2"). **NEVER edit the master branch!**
2. Either a) create a new file in the Github repository, pasting in the xml already in the DropBox folder and assigning the same name; OR b) work on a file already in the repository.  **Check to see what your colleagues already have branched. We want to avoid TWO branches working on the same file, otherwise it will be hard to merge BOTH sets of changes with the master.**
3. Mark up your edition, making regular commits with clear and intuitive titles and descriptions. Flag queries as "Issues" to discuss with the group, but try to be specific and goal-oriented.
4. Begin a Pull Request to request feedback from collaborators (use @). Collaborators either make suggestions as comments or edit and commit changes *directly to the same branch* (i.e. steps 2b & 3).
5. Accept or reject peer-reviewed suggestions and merge the final edition _mutatis mutandis_ to the master.
6. Repeat for the other files.

##Best Practices
1. The Golden Rule is: write titles and descriptions with the clarity and diligence that you would love others to do for you.
2. At the start of each session, familiarize yourself with the branches already open. Double-check: a) what branch you are working on! i.e. select it from the drop-down menu; b) that nobody else already has a branch open working on the files you want to change. (Instead, add commits to their branch during the "pull request phase", or wait for that branch to be merged.) __Never edit the master branch!_
3. Use the template when marking up and revising files.
a) *If it needs changing, make a new branch and update the template, but please communicate this with everyone else directly (through @ comments) so we have a chance to review that and implement changes in other files.*
b) Joe will try to see every document at this stage but please make sure *at least one other person someone else* is looking at your work before merging.
4. [Please add your own suggestions, e.g. useful tags, naming conventions, etc. *Though n.b. my goal is to keep things as simple as possible and only introduce steps to the procedure when necessary.*]
